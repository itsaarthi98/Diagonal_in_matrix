# Diagonal_in_matrix
The program takes the size of the square matrix as input from the user. Then, it prompts the user to enter the elements of the matrix. After that, it calculates the sum of the elements along the main diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right) and the secondary diagonal (from the top-right to the bottom-left). Finally, it displays the sums of both diagonals.
